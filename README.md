# Classification_using_Lucene_6.5.1
The repository contains the class(es) written for classification of 20 News Groups, modified to be compatible with Lucene 6.5.1


# Apache Lucene
Lucene is basically used for full text indexing or searching purposes.
The book which I referred was 'Text Processing in JAVA by Mitzi Morris'.

The original version of the code can be found at
https://github.com/colloquial/javabook/tree/master/src/applucene/src/com/colloquial/applucene
ClassifyNewGroups.java class is for the classification of 20NewsGroups.
The data set can be downloaded from http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/
For classification purpose '20news-bydate.tar.gz' was used as it was already divided into test and training set.
